  <h3>Technical Optimization for Indian Connectivity</h3>
  <p>Recognizing the varied internet infrastructure across India, from high-speed connections in urban centers to more limited bandwidth in rural areas, our wheel maker has been technically optimized for reliable performance across all connectivity scenarios. The application loads efficiently even on slower connections, with progressive rendering that displays essential functionality first before loading decorative elements. This approach ensures users throughout India can create and use wheels without frustration, regardless of their specific connectivity situation.</p>
  
  <p>For areas with intermittent connectivity, our platform includes offline capabilities that allow wheels to continue functioning even if the connection drops temporarily. This resilience is particularly valuable for educational settings in developing regions or for events in locations with unreliable internet infrastructure. The application's lightweight design minimizes data usage, an important consideration for many Indian users on limited mobile data plans.</p>
  
  <p>Mobile optimization receives particular attention, with touch-friendly controls and interfaces designed for the smartphone-first usage patterns common throughout India. The wheel performs smoothly even on more affordable device models prevalent in the Indian market, ensuring accessibility across socioeconomic segments rather than requiring the latest premium devices.</p>
