# Logo PNG File
# 
# This is a placeholder for your logo.png file.
# 
# To add your actual logo:
# 1. Create or obtain your logo image (PNG format recommended)
# 2. Save it as "logo.png" in this directory (static/images/)
# 3. Recommended size: 60x60 pixels or larger (will be scaled down)
# 4. Make sure it has a transparent background for best results
# 
# The template will automatically use this logo if it exists,
# otherwise it will fall back to the SVG version or the Font Awesome icon.
